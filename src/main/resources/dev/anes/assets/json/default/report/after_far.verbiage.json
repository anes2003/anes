    "description": "In accordance with the laws and regulation of the State of California, we are required to provide you with the following information prior to application of pesticides to your property.\n\n\"State law requires that you be given the following information: CAUTION--PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Structural Pest Control Companies are registered and regulated by the Structural Pest Control Board, and apply pesticides which are registered and approved for use by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Registration is granted when the state finds that, based on existing scientific evidence, there are no appreciable risks if proper use conditions are followed or that the risks are outweighed by the benefits. The degree of risk depends upon the degree of exposure, so exposure should be minimized.\"\n\n\"If within 24 hours following application you experience symptoms similar to common seasonal illness comparable to the flu, contact your physician or poison control center (800) 876-4766 and your pest control company immediately.\"\n\nFor further information, contact any of the following:\nAvertapest, Inc.

    "description": "NOTICE TO OWNER\n\nUnder the California Mechanics Lien Law any structural pest control company which contracts to do work for you, any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplier or other person who helps to improve your property, but is not paid for his or her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your structural pest control company in full if the subcontractor, laborers or suppliers remain unpaid.\n\nTo preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or material suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled \"Preliminary Notice.\" Prime contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a lien against your property. Its purpose is to notify you of persons who may have a right to file a lien against your property if they are not paid.",
